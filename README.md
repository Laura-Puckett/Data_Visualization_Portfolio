## Pacific Northwest Stream Temperature Shiny App

A major heatwave struck the Pacific Northwest in June 2021, and stream temperatures in many locations grew warmer than 68F - a critical threshold over which salmon experience great stress and are more likely to contract diseases or die. Heat-related salmon mortality was recorded in the region as a result of the 2015 and 2021 heat waves. 

In this project, I displayed stream temperatures from USGS stations within the Pacific Northwest in an interactive app.

## Comparing spaceborne LiDAR datasets 
- Code repository [link](https://github.com/Laura-Puckett/lidar_comparisons)

This workflow is intended for comparing GEDI, ICESat-2, or both against airborne LiDAR data for an area. Steps include downloading data, building geometries    for each spaceborne lidar footprint, extracting the intersecting airborne LiDAR values, and plotting results.  The workflow was built to run on a computing cluster, because the process is computationally intensive.
